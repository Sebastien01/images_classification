Welcome to my classification project. My goal was to practice computer vision.

I first tried to build models on `cnn_from_scratch.ipynb` to get a baseline

Then I used Transfer Learning on `transfer_learning.ipynb`

Data :
- 9302 images (150x150) belonging to 6 classes for training
- 3983 images for testing
- 3000 images to predict
