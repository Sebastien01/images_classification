Welcome to my multiclass classification project.

I did everything on this Colab file `cnn_from_scratch.ipynb`

Data :
- 9302 images (150x150) belonging to 6 classes for training
- 3983 images for testing
- 3000 images to predict

For now my model has an accuracy of 83.7% which I consider quite good, 
but I think I could make it better with regularization or drop_out layers.
